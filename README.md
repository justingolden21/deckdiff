# DeckDIFF

Chrome plugin for diffing Hearthstone decks.

Just copy a deckcode to your clipboard and press the huge plus sign to add a deck.
Cards are displayed in cost/name order side-by-side and the differences are highlighted.
The plugin remembers your decks but you can manually remove them either one at a time (using the X icon in the top right corner of the deck's header) or all at once (using the clear button in the top right corner of the whole plugin window).

Feature ideas and pull requests are welcome.
